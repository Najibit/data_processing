Questions
Answer the following questions in your own words. This assignment will only be graded pass or fail.

1. Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.
    The == operator is the equality operator, excluding type.
    The === operator is the equality operator, including type.
      1 == '1' // True, because of automatic type conversion.
      1 === '1' // False, because one is numeric and one is a string.

2. Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often.)
    When a function gets declared in JavaScript, it contains a function definition, as well as
    a closure. A function definition is the literal function, and the closure is the collection
    of all the variables that are in (lexical) scope at the time the function is created. The return
    value of this function doesn't get destroyed together with the local execution context.
    Closures become especially relevant when a function returns a function. The returned functions
    has access to variables that exist in the local scope.

3. Explain what higher order functions are.
    A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument,
    or returns another function as the result of the parent's function.

4. Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector.
    A query selector is a [Document] method that returns the first element
    (method parameter) of the document that matches the (CSS) selector. Example:

      let nav = document.querySelector("#nav");
